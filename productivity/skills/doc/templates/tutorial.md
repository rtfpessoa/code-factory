```bash
mkdir {{PROJECT_NAME}}
cd {{PROJECT_NAME}}
```

{{Any additional setup steps...}}

## Part 1: {{FIRST_CONCEPT}}

### Background

{{Explain the concept before doing. Why does this matter? What problem does it solve?}}

### Try It

Let's start with a simple example:

```{{LANGUAGE}}
{{STARTER_CODE}}
```

Run it:

```bash
{{RUN_COMMAND}}
```

You should see:

```text
{{EXPECTED_OUTPUT}}
```

### Understand It

Let's break down what happened:

1. **Line {{N}}:** {{EXPLANATION}}
2. **Line {{N}}:** {{EXPLANATION}}

> [!TIP]
> {{HELPFUL_INSIGHT}}

### Practice

Try modifying the code to {{MODIFICATION_CHALLENGE}}. Expected result: {{EXPECTED_RESULT}}.

## Part 2: {{SECOND_CONCEPT}}

### Background

{{Continue building on Part 1...}}

### Try It

Building on our previous code:

```{{LANGUAGE}}
{{EXTENDED_CODE}}
```

### Understand It

{{Explanation of new concepts introduced...}}

### Practice

{{Another hands-on exercise...}}

## Part 3: {{THIRD_CONCEPT}}

{{Continue the pattern...}}

## Putting It All Together

Now let's combine everything into a complete {{ARTIFACT_TYPE}}:

```{{LANGUAGE}}
{{COMPLETE_CODE}}
```

### Test Your Work

Verify everything works:

```bash
{{VERIFICATION_COMMAND}}
```

Expected output:

```text
{{FINAL_OUTPUT}}
```

## What You've Learned

Let's recap what you've accomplished:
