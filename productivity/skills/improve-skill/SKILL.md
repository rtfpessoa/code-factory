# Improve Skills and Tools

Announce: "I'm using the improve skill to reflect on recent work and improve the skills, tools, and documentation in this repo."

## Step 1: Gather Context

Run in parallel:

- `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (confirm repo root)
- `git log --oneline -10` (recent work for context)

Then discover repo assets (run Glob calls in parallel):

- `**/skills/*/SKILL.md` (all skills)
- `**/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (all plugin manifests)
- `**/agents/*.md` (agent definitions)

Read each plugin's `plugin.json` to note current versions (needed for version bumps later).

Read `AGENTS.md` for current repo conventions.

**If not in the code-factory repo:** inform the user this skill is designed for the code-factory plugin marketplace and stop.

## Step 2: Reflect on Recent Experience

Review the session's work by examining concrete artifacts:

1. Run `git log --oneline -20` and `git diff HEAD~5..HEAD --stat` to identify which files changed recently.
2. For each changed skill, read it and evaluate against the four dimensions below.
3. If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a focus area, narrow to that area only.
4. If there is no recent session context, ask the user what area to improve or offer a general audit of all skills.

### Evaluation Dimensions

| Dimension | Key Question | How to Check |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Friction** | Where did you hesitate or get confused? | Re-read skill instructions as if encountering them for the first time |
| **Token waste** | What content is verbose or redundant? | Look for paragraphs that could be tables, repeated information across skills |
| **Missing pieces** | What manual steps should be automated? | Check for error cases not covered, skills that should exist but don't |
| **Confusion** | What instructions are ambiguous? | Look for vague verbs ("handle", "process", "deal with") without specific actions |

For each finding, note: the file, the dimension, and a one-sentence description.

## Step 3: Make Improvements

Apply changes directly. You have full authority to improve any file in this repo. Do not ask permission for improvements within existing files.

Prioritize improvements in this order:

1. **Critical**: broken cross-references, missing error handling, incorrect instructions
2. **Functional**: vague instructions, missing edge cases, inconsistent patterns
3. **Polish**: filler word removal, table formatting, redundant content

### Improving Skills

**Location:** `{plugin}/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`

Read `references/skill-quality-checklist.md` for quality criteria, filler words list, before/after examples, and Definition of Done checklist. Apply each criterion.

**Version bump required:** Any change to a skill or agent file requires a version bump in the owning plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (patch for fixes, minor for new features).

### Improving Documentation

**Files:** `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, skill `SKILL.md` files

- Keep instructions actionable and specific (commands, not descriptions)
- Remove ambiguity that caused confusion during your session
- Add missing conventions you discovered

### Improving Tools

**Files:** `Makefile`, `init.sh`, config files

- Minimal output on success, clear messages on failure
- Sensible defaults, fail fast
- Add missing validation targets if gaps are found

### Creating New Skills or Plugins

Read `references/new-skill-template.md` for creation checklists and YAML templates.

**For significant new features**, suggest running `/execplan` first instead of implementing inline.

## Step 4: Validate

Run after all changes:

```bash
make all
```

### Iteration Loop

If `make all` fails:

1. Read the error output to identify which check failed.
2. Fix the specific issue (do not make unrelated changes).
3. Re-run `make all`.
4. Repeat until all checks pass. Maximum 3 iterations — if still failing after 3 attempts, report the remaining failures to the user.

### Manual Quality Checks

After `make all` passes, verify these criteria (not covered by automated checks):

| Check | How to Verify |
|-------|---------------|
| First-read clarity | Re-read each updated skill as if seeing it for the first time — is every step unambiguous? |
| No filler words | Search updated files for: simply, just, easily, basically, actually, really, very |
| Naming conventions | New files follow `{plugin}/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` pattern |
| Description convention | All descriptions start with "Use when" |

## Step 5: Report

Present a summary of all changes. For non-trivial improvements, include a brief before/after snippet.

```
## Improvements Made

### Skills Updated
- **{plugin}:{skill-name}**: {what changed and why}
  - Before: {brief excerpt}
  - After: {brief excerpt}

### Documentation Updated
- **{file}**: {what changed and why}

### Tools Improved
- **{tool}**: {what changed and why}

### New Skills Created
- **{plugin}:{skill-name}**: {what it does}

### Version Bumps
- **{plugin}**: {old} -> {new}

### Suggested Follow-ups
- {anything that needs deeper work via /execplan}
```

Omit any section with no entries.

## Example

### Invocation

```
/improve-skill git
```

### What Happens

1. Gathers all skills in the `git/` plugin and reads current versions.
2. Reviews `git log` for recent changes to git skills.
3. Finds: `/commit` Step 2 says "Analyze changes" without specifying *what* to analyze.
4. Reads `references/skill-quality-checklist.md` — flags the vague instruction under "Friction" dimension.
5. Rewrites Step 2 with an explicit list of analysis targets (title, documentation links, motivation, summary).
6. Runs `make all` — passes.
7. Reports the improvement with before/after.

### Sample Report

```
## Improvements Made

### Skills Updated
- **git:commit**: Step 2 now lists specific analysis targets instead of vague "Analyze changes"
  - Before: "Analyze the staged changes"
  - After: "For each staged file, identify: title line, documentation links, motivation, summary"

### Version Bumps
- **git**: 0.3.0 -> 0.3.1
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Not in code-factory repo | Inform the user this skill is designed for the code-factory plugin marketplace. Stop. |
| No recent session context and no focus area | Ask the user what area to improve, or offer a general audit of all skills. |
| `make all` failure after 3 fix attempts | Report remaining failures to the user with the specific error output. Do not loop indefinitely. |
| Multiple plugins need version bumps | Bump each plugin independently. Run `make check-versions` to verify each bump. |
| Broken cross-reference to non-existent skill | If the referenced skill should exist, create it (see `references/new-skill-template.md`). If not, fix the reference. |
| Significant interface change | Describe the proposed change (skill name, arguments, behavior) and ask the user before applying. |
| Reference file missing | Proceed using inline principles: concise, scannable, complete, consistent, self-contained. |
