# Skill Quality Checklist

Reference for evaluating and improving skills during `/improve-skill` sessions.

## Quality Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Conciseness | 25% | One sentence per concept. Tables over paragraphs. No filler words. |
| Scannability | 25% | Clear headings. Bullet points. Working examples. Quick-start workflow early. |
| Completeness | 25% | All edge cases addressed. Error handling section present. Copy-paste ready code blocks. |
| Consistency | 15% | Announce line present. Numbered Steps. Error Handling section. Follows AGENTS.md conventions. |
| Self-containment | 10% | Works without external context. No references to AGENTS.md content. Duplication preferred over external dependencies. |

## Filler Words to Remove

Remove these words — they add no information:

> simply, just, easily, basically, actually, really, very, obviously, clearly, of course, in order to, it should be noted that, please note that

## Structure Priorities

1. Quick-start or most common workflow early
2. Copy-paste ready code blocks with expected output
3. Tables for reference, not paragraphs
4. Specific commands, not vague instructions ("Run `make all`" not "Validate your changes")

## Before/After Example

### Before (vague, wordy)

```markdown
## Step 2: Process Changes

You should basically just look at the changes that were made and think about
whether they are correct. It's important to actually verify that everything
is working properly before proceeding to the next step. Please note that you
should also check for any potential issues.
```

### After (specific, concise)

```markdown
## Step 2: Verify Changes

1. Run `git diff --stat` to list changed files.
2. For each changed file, verify:
   - No unintended modifications outside the target area
   - New code follows existing patterns in the file
   - No debug statements or temporary code remain
3. Run `make all` to confirm all checks pass.
```

## Definition of Done

A skill improvement is complete when:

- [ ] All frontmatter fields present and valid (`name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `user-invocable`)
- [ ] Description starts with "Use when" and includes trigger phrases
- [ ] Announce line present as first content line after heading
- [ ] Steps are numbered with specific actions (commands, not vague instructions)
- [ ] Error handling covers all identified failure modes
- [ ] No filler words remain in updated content
- [ ] Readable on first pass by someone unfamiliar with the skill
- [ ] Cross-references to other skills validated (`make check-refs`)
- [ ] Version bump applied to owning plugin's `plugin.json`
- [ ] `make all` passes
