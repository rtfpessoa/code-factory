# Feature Development Orchestrator

Announce: "I'm using the /do skill to orchestrate feature development with lifecycle tracking."

## Overview

This skill orchestrates feature development through a **multi-phase state machine** with:
- **On-disk state** stored outside the repo (never committed)
- **Specialized subagents** for research, planning, implementation, and validation
- **Resumable execution** from any interruption point
- **Atomic commits** via `/commit` skill
- **Two interaction modes**: Interactive (default) or Autonomous

## Hard Rules

- **Plan before code.** No implementation until research and planning phases complete.
- **Workspace isolation first.** Create worktree and branch before any code changes (EXECUTE phase).
- **Atomic commits only.** Commit after every logical change, not batched.
- **Hard stop on blockers.** When encountering ambiguity or missing information, stop and report rather than guessing.
- **State is sacred.** Always update state files after significant actions. Never commit state files.

## Interaction Modes

**Interactive Mode (default):**
- User reviews and approves outputs at each phase transition
- User can provide feedback, request changes, or adjust direction
- Best for: complex features, unfamiliar codebases, learning

**Autonomous Mode (`--auto` flag):**
- Orchestrator makes best decisions based on research
- Proceeds through all phases without interruption
- Reports summary only at completion or on blockers
- Best for: well-defined tasks, trusted patterns, speed

## State Storage

State is stored in the **current working directory's** `.plans/do/<run-id>/`.

- **Before EXECUTE phase:** State lives in the source repo's `.plans/`
- **During EXECUTE phase:** State is copied to and maintained in the **worktree's** `.plans/`

**CRITICAL:** Once a worktree is created, all state file updates MUST go to the **worktree's** `.plans/` directory, never back to the source repo. This keeps all working files together in the isolated workspace.

Each run creates:
```
<cwd>/.plans/do/<run-id>/
  FEATURE.md              # Canonical state (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
  RESEARCH.md             # Research phase outputs (codebase map, research brief)
  PLAN.md                 # Execution plan (milestones, tasks, validation strategy)
  REVIEW.md               # Plan review feedback
  VALIDATION.md           # Validation results and evidence
```

**Critical:** `.plans/` files are NEVER committed to git. Add `.plans/` to `.gitignore`.

## Iteration Behavior

Before starting, determine intent from the user's query:

1. **Analyze the query**: Does it reference a state file/run-id (resume) or provide a new feature description (fresh start)?
2. **If fresh start**: Create new run, proceed through RESEARCH phase.
3. **If resuming**: Parse state file, reconcile git state, continue from current phase.
4. **If iterating**: User is providing feedback on existing work. Address the feedback directly within the current phase.

**Feedback handling during phases:**
- **RESEARCH phase feedback**: Adjust scope, investigate additional areas
- **PLAN_DRAFT feedback**: Modify milestones, tasks, or approach
- **EXECUTE feedback**: Modify code as requested, commit the change
- **VALIDATE feedback**: Add tests, fix issues, re-run validation

## Step 1: Initialize State Directory

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
STATE_ROOT="$REPO_ROOT/.plans/do"
mkdir -p "$STATE_ROOT"

# Ensure .plans/ is gitignored
if ! grep -q "^\.plans/$" "$REPO_ROOT/.gitignore" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo ".plans/" >> "$REPO_ROOT/.gitignore"
fi
```

## Step 2: Discover Existing Runs

Search for active runs (not marked DONE):

```bash
# List active runs; produces no output if no runs exist
find "$STATE_ROOT" -name "FEATURE.md" -exec grep -L "current_phase: DONE" {} \; 2>/dev/null || true
```

For each discovered run, parse the YAML frontmatter to extract:
- `run_id`
- `current_phase` (RESEARCH, PLAN_DRAFT, PLAN_REVIEW, EXECUTE, VALIDATE, DONE)
- `phase_status` (not_started, in_progress, blocked, in_review, complete)
- `branch`
- `last_checkpoint`

## Step 3: Parse Interaction Mode

Check `$ARGUMENTS` for the `--auto` flag:
- If `--auto` present: set `interaction_mode = "autonomous"`
- Otherwise: set `interaction_mode = "interactive"` (default)

Remove the flag from arguments before further processing.

## Step 4: Mode Selection

**IMPORTANT: Never skip phases.** When arguments are a feature description, you MUST start the full workflow (RESEARCH -> PLAN -> EXECUTE). Do not implement directly, regardless of perceived simplicity.

**Classification rules — apply in this order:**

1. **State file reference** — `$ARGUMENTS` contains `FEATURE.md` or is a path to an existing `.plans/do/` state file (but NOT a URL starting with `http://` or `https://`):
   - Verify file exists
   - Parse phase status and route to appropriate phase
   - Inherit `interaction_mode` from state file or use specified flag

2. **Feature description, no active runs** — `$ARGUMENTS` is a feature description (including arguments containing URLs) and no active runs exist:
   - **new** mode: Start fresh workflow

3. **Feature description, active runs exist** — `$ARGUMENTS` is a feature description and active runs exist:
```
AskUserQuestion(
  header: "Active runs found",
  question: "Found <N> active feature runs. What would you like to do?",
  options: [
    "Start new feature" -- Begin a fresh workflow for the new feature,
    "<run-id>: <feature-name> (phase: <phase>)" -- Resume this run
  ]
)
```

4. **No arguments:**
   - If active runs exist: list them and ask which to resume
   - If no active runs: prompt for feature description

## Step 5: Dispatch by Mode

### New Mode

Generate a run ID: `<timestamp>-<slug>` where slug is derived from feature description.

Create the run directory and initial state file at `$STATE_ROOT/<run-id>/FEATURE.md`:

```yaml
---
schema_version: 1
run_id: <run-id>
repo_root: <REPO_ROOT>
branch: null
base_ref: null
current_phase: RESEARCH
phase_status: not_started
milestone_current: null
last_checkpoint: <ISO timestamp>
last_commit: null
interaction_mode: <interactive|autonomous>
---
```

Dispatch to orchestrator:

```
Task(
  subagent_type = "productivity:do-orchestrator",
  description = "Start feature: <short description>",
  prompt = "
Start a new feature development workflow.

<feature_request>
<the user's feature description>
</feature_request>

<state_path>
<path to FEATURE.md>
</state_path>

<repo_root>
<REPO_ROOT>
</repo_root>

<interaction_mode>
<interactive|autonomous>
</interaction_mode>

<instructions>
- Begin with RESEARCH phase
- You are the single writer of the state files - update them after every significant action
- Write phase artifacts to the current working directory's .plans/do/<run-id>/:
  - RESEARCH.md: codebase map and research brief after RESEARCH phase
  - PLAN.md: milestones, tasks, and validation strategy after PLAN_DRAFT phase
  - REVIEW.md: review feedback after PLAN_REVIEW phase
  - VALIDATION.md: validation results after VALIDATE phase
- Update FEATURE.md frontmatter and living sections (Progress Log, Decisions Made, etc.) continuously
- Once in a worktree, ALL state updates go to the worktree's .plans/ (never back to source repo)
- Coordinate subagents for each phase
- Never commit .plans/ files (they are gitignored)
- BEFORE EXECUTE phase: call /worktree first, then /branch (mandatory, no exceptions)
- Use /commit for atomic commits during EXECUTE (after every logical change)
- Use /pr to create pull request in DONE phase
- Route through: RESEARCH -> PLAN_DRAFT -> PLAN_REVIEW -> EXECUTE -> VALIDATE -> DONE

INTERACTION MODE RULES:
- If interactive: Present findings and ask for user approval at each phase transition
- If autonomous: Make best decisions based on research, proceed without asking
- Both modes: Always stop and ask if you encounter a blocker or ambiguity you cannot resolve
</instructions>
"
)
```

### Resume Mode

Read the state file to determine current phase and status.

Run git reconciliation:
1. Check if on correct branch
2. Handle dirty working tree per `uncommitted_policy` in state

Dispatch to orchestrator with resume context:

```
Task(
  subagent_type = "productivity:do-orchestrator",
  description = "Resume feature: <run-id>",
  prompt = "
Resume an interrupted feature development workflow.

<state_path>
<path to FEATURE.md>
</state_path>

<state_content>
<full FEATURE.md content>
</state_content>

<instructions>
- Read FEATURE.md and phase artifacts (RESEARCH.md, PLAN.md, etc.) to understand context and progress
- Reconcile git state (branch, working tree)
- Continue from the current phase and task
- Update state files as you make progress
- Never commit .plans/ files (they are gitignored)
</instructions>
"
)
```

### Status Mode

If user asks for status without wanting to resume:

```
Task(
  subagent_type = "productivity:do-orchestrator",
  description = "Status check: <run-id>",
  prompt = "
Report status of a feature development run without making changes.

<state_path>
<path to FEATURE.md>
</state_path>

<instructions>
- Read and parse the state file
- Report: current phase, progress percentage, last checkpoint, any blockers
- Do not modify state or code
</instructions>
"
)
```

## Phase Flow

```
RESEARCH -> PLAN_DRAFT -> PLAN_REVIEW -> EXECUTE -> VALIDATE -> DONE
              ^                |             ^          |
              |                v             |          v
              +--- (changes requested) ------+-- (fix forward) --+
```

### RESEARCH Phase
- Spawn `do-explorer` for **local codebase** mapping (modules, patterns, conventions)
- Spawn `do-researcher` for **Confluence + external** research (design docs, RFCs, APIs)
- Output: Context, Assumptions, Constraints, Risks, Open Questions
- **Both sources are mandatory** - do not skip Confluence search
- **Interactive**: Present research summary, ask user to confirm assumptions and scope
- **Autonomous**: Proceed with best interpretation, log assumptions in Decisions Made

### PLAN_DRAFT Phase
- Spawn `do-planner` to create plan (references both codebase findings AND Confluence context)
- Output: Milestones, Task Breakdown, Validation Strategy
- Plan must embed relevant context inline (not just links)
- **Interactive**: Present plan, ask user to approve or request changes
- **Autonomous**: Proceed to review, let reviewer catch issues

### PLAN_REVIEW Phase
- Spawn `do-reviewer` for critique
- Output: Review report, required changes
- May loop back to PLAN_DRAFT
- **Interactive**: Present review findings, ask user for final approval before execution
- **Autonomous**: Auto-approve if no critical issues, loop back for required changes only

### EXECUTE Phase
**MANDATORY before any code changes:**
1. Call `/worktree` to create isolated workspace
2. Call `/branch` to create feature branch
3. Update state file with branch name

**Then execute tasks:**
- Execute tasks with **atomic commits via `/commit` after EVERY logical change**
- Update Progress section continuously
- **Commit frequency:** after each function, fix, test, or refactor — not batched

### VALIDATE Phase
- Spawn `do-validator` to run checks
- Output: Validation report, pass/fail decision
- May loop back to EXECUTE for fixes
- **Interactive**: Present validation results, ask user before creating PR
- **Autonomous**: Auto-proceed to DONE if validation passes

### DONE Phase
- Write Outcomes & Retrospective
- **Create PR via `/pr` skill** (pushes branch, creates PR with description)
- Report PR URL to user
- Archive run state
- **Both modes**: Always report final PR URL to user

## Error Handling

- **State file not found**: List discovered runs or prompt for new feature
- **Git branch conflict**: Report and offer resolution options
- **Phase failure**: Mark phase as `blocked`, record blocker, offer manual intervention
- **Subagent failure**: Log to agent-outputs, update state with failure context
