# Code Tour

Announce: "I'm using the tour skill to give a guided walkthrough of the codebase."

Walk through code to explain architecture, flows, or structure. Two modes: **interactive** (step-by-step with user) or **written** (complete document).

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` - The topic, service, or code area to tour (e.g., "apm-services-api", "authentication flow", "src/handlers")

## Mode Selection

Pick mode based on user intent:

- **Interactive** (default): User said "tour", "walk me through", "show me". Step-by-step with pauses.
- **Written**: User said "write a tour", "document the architecture", "write up how X works", or added `--written`. Produces a complete markdown document.

If unclear, ask the user which mode they prefer.

## Step 1: Discover Code Context

1. Use Glob/Grep to locate relevant source files for `$ARGUMENTS`
2. If Atlassian MCP tools are available, query for internal documentation and Confluence pages
3. Search the current repo and common code directories for relevant source files

## Step 2: Build Tour Plan

Identify stops in logical order:

1. **Overview**: High-level context from documentation
2. **Entry point**: main() or equivalent starting point
3. **Dependencies**: Initialization and dependency injection
4. **Core logic**: Key handlers, routes, or business logic
5. **Integration points**: Connections to other services

Adapt stops to the topic — not every tour needs all five.

## Step 3: Deliver Tour

### Interactive Mode

Show code inline and explain it stop-by-stop, waiting for the user between each.

#### How to Present Code

Use the Read tool to load relevant file sections. Present code as fenced blocks with file path and line numbers:

```
`path/to/file.go:42-68`
⟶ [code snippet]
```

Keep snippets focused — show only the lines relevant to the current stop (typically 10-30 lines). Use sub-agents (Task with subagent_type=Explore) to research code you need context on before explaining.

#### Pacing Rules

**CRITICAL**: You MUST wait for user confirmation between stops.

1. After explaining a stop, ALWAYS ask before moving on:
   - "Ready to see [next concept]?"
   - "Any questions before we move on?"
   - "Let me know when you're ready to continue"

2. NEVER blast through multiple stops without user confirmation between each.

3. If the user asks a question about the current code, answer it fully before offering to continue.

#### Example Flow

```
[You] "Let me give you a tour of {service}. First, let me find the relevant code..."
[Read files, query docs]

[You] "This service does X. Here's the entry point:"
[Show code snippet from main()]
[Explain what it does]
"Ready to see how dependencies are wired up?"

[Wait for user: "yes"]

[Show next code snippet]
[Explain, then ask for confirmation again]

[User asks "what does this function do?"]
[Read the function, research with sub-agent, explain]
```

### Written Mode

Produce a complete tour as a single markdown document. No pausing — research everything, then write.

#### Process

1. Complete Steps 1-2 above
2. Use sub-agents (Task with subagent_type=Explore) in parallel to research each stop
3. Write the full tour document

#### Output Format

Write the tour to a file (default: `/tmp/tour-{topic}.md`) or print inline if short.

```markdown
# Code Tour: {Topic}

{1-2 sentence overview of what this component/service does}

---

## Stop 1: {Title}

📍 `path/to/file.go:42-68`

{Explanation of what this code does and why it matters}

\`\`\`go
// relevant code excerpt
\`\`\`

---

## Stop 2: {Title}

📍 `path/to/file.go:120-145`

{Explanation}

\`\`\`go
// relevant code excerpt
\`\`\`

---

## Data Flow

\`\`\`
component A → component B → component C
\`\`\`
```

#### Guidelines

- Each stop covers one logical area (a type, a handler, an integration point)
- Include inline code snippets showing the key lines
- End with a data flow summary showing how pieces connect
- Reference actual file paths and line numbers so the reader can navigate

### PR Comment Mode

When the user asks to post a code tour as a comment on a PR (e.g., "post this tour as a PR comment", "write a code tour comment on PR #123"), generate a single PR comment containing the full tour.

#### Gathering context

1. Fetch the PR metadata and diff:
   ```bash
   gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json title,body,files,commits
   gh pr diff {PR_NUMBER}
   ```
2. Read the changed files to understand the code in full context (not just the diff hunks).

#### Building diff links

GitHub diff links use SHA-256 hashes of file paths as anchors. Compute them with:

```bash
python3 -c "
import hashlib
files = ['path/to/file.go', ...]
for f in files:
    h = hashlib.sha256(f.encode()).hexdigest()
    print(f'{f} -> {h}')
"
```

Link format: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/pull/{number}/files#diff-{sha256_hash}R{line_number}`
- `R{line}` for right side (new code), `L{line}` for left side (old code)
- For line ranges: `R{start}-R{end}`

**IMPORTANT**: Use HTML `<a>` tags with `target="_blank"` so links open in a new tab:
```html
<a href="https://github.com/.../pull/123/files#diff-{hash}R{line}" target="_blank"><code>file.go</code> — description</a>
```

#### Comment structure

Use collapsible `<details>` sections for each "stop" on the tour:

```markdown
## Code Tour

A guided walkthrough of the changes in this PR. Each stop covers one logical area — expand to read.

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Stop 1: Title</strong> — brief subtitle</summary>

📍 <a href="https://github.com/.../pull/123/files#diff-{hash}R{line}-R{line}" target="_blank"><code>file.go</code> — description</a>

Explanation with inline code snippets:

\`\`\`go
// relevant code excerpt
\`\`\`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Stop 2: Title</strong> — brief subtitle</summary>
...
</details>

---

### Data flow summary

\`\`\`
component A → component B → component C
\`\`\`
```

#### Guidelines

- Each stop should cover one logical area of the change (a new type, a caller, an integration point, etc.)
- Include inline code snippets showing the key lines — don't make the reader expand every diff
- Link to specific diff regions so readers can click through to full context
- End with a data flow summary showing how the pieces connect
- Write the comment to a temp file and post with `gh pr comment {number} --body-file /tmp/file.md`

#### When to use this mode

- User explicitly asks to post the tour as a PR comment
- User provides a PR URL and asks for a written tour
- After an interactive tour, user asks to capture it as a PR comment

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| No topic provided | Ask the user what they want a tour of |
| No relevant files found | Report that no matching code was found, suggest alternative search terms |
| Atlassian MCP not available | Skip Confluence search, proceed with local codebase only |
| `gh` not available (PR comment mode) | Inform user that `gh` CLI is required for posting PR comments. Stop. |
| PR not found (PR comment mode) | Report error. List recent PRs with `gh pr list --limit 5`. |
| File too large to display | Show key sections only, link to full file path for reference |
