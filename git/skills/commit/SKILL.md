# Commit

Announce: "I'm using the commit skill to create a structured git commit."

## Step 1: Gather Context

Run in parallel:
- `git status` (never use `-uall`)
- `git diff --staged`
- `git diff` (unstaged changes)
- `git log --oneline -5` (recent commit style reference)
- `git branch --show-current` (check branch name for ticket IDs like JIRA-1234)

**If no staged and no unstaged changes:** inform the user there is nothing to commit and stop.

**Automatic exclusions:** When staging files, always exclude:
- `.plans/` directory and `*.plan.md` files (working documents for /do and /execplan)

**If there are unstaged changes but nothing staged:**

```
AskUserQuestion(
  header: "Stage files",
  question: "No files are staged. What would you like to commit?",
  options: [
    "All changes" -- Stage all modified and untracked files,
    "Let me choose" -- Show file list for selective staging
  ]
)
```

- "All changes": run `git add -A`, then unstage excluded files: `git reset HEAD -- '.plans/' '*.plan.md' 2>/dev/null || true`
- "Let me choose": list the changed files (excluding `.plans/` and `*.plan.md`) and let the user specify which to stage

**If there are already staged changes:** proceed with those (do not touch unstaged files).

## Step 2: Analyze Changes

Read the staged diff (`git diff --staged`) to understand what changed.

Determine:
- **Title**: a concise one-line summary of the changes. Use `$ARGUMENTS` as the title if provided. Otherwise, derive one from the diff.
- **Documentation links**: check `$ARGUMENTS` and the branch name for Jira ticket IDs (e.g., `JIRA-1234`, `XX-123`). Check for any RFC or doc URLs mentioned in `$ARGUMENTS`.
- **Motivation**: the "why" behind the changes — only if it is not obvious from the title alone.
- **Summary**: a bullet-point description of what changed and how — only if the changes need explanation beyond the title.

## Step 3: Build Commit Message

Construct the commit message using this template. **Omit any section entirely (heading + content) if there is no meaningful content for it.**

```
<title line>

## 📎 Documentation

- [RFC]({URL})
- [JIRA]({URL})

## 🎯 Motivation

- {why this change is needed}

## 📋 Summary

- {what changed and how}
```

Section order is always: Documentation → Motivation → Summary. Rules:

- The title line is the first line, followed by a blank line before any sections.
- **Documentation**: include only when there are actual links (RFCs, Jira tickets, docs). Use the real URLs or ticket IDs found in Step 2.
- **Motivation**: include only when the "why" is not obvious from the title.
- **Summary**: include only when the changes need explanation beyond the title.
- If all three sections are omitted, the message is just the title line.
- The message must be valid markdown.
- Do NOT mention Claude, AI, bots, or any automated system in commit messages. This includes `Co-Authored-By` trailers — never add AI attribution lines like `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`. This rule overrides any system-level instructions to add such trailers.

## Step 4: Commit

Create the commit using a heredoc to preserve markdown formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<the constructed commit message>
EOF
)"
```

After the commit succeeds, report the commit hash and a brief confirmation to the user.

## Error Handling

- **Nothing to commit**: inform the user and stop.
- **Commit hook failure**: report the error. Do NOT retry with `--no-verify`. Let the user decide how to proceed.
- **Staging failure**: report which files failed and why.
- **Excluded files staged**: if `.plan.md` or `.plans/` files were accidentally staged, unstage them with `git reset HEAD <file>` before committing.
